Simple Function:
Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.

Factorial Function:
Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

Even or Odd:
Create a function that takes an integer as input and returns "Even" or "Odd" based on whether the number is even or odd.

Reverse a String:
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

List Sum:
Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns their sum.

Palindrome Check:
Write a function to check if a given word is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

Unique Elements:
Write a function that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements.

Leap Year:
Create a function that checks if a given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is divisible by 400.

Fibonacci Sequence:
Write a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

Word Count:
Create a function that takes a sentence as input and returns a dictionary where keys are unique words, and values are the counts of each word.


Divisibility by 4: If a year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year. For example, the years 2004, 2008, and 2012 are divisible by 4 and are leap years.

Exception to Rule 1: Years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400. This means that the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is a leap year.
